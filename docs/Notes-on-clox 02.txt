Dynamically-Types-Languages

Variable types are checked at runtime rather than compile time. This means that you don't need to declare the data type of the variable explicitly, the
language interpreter determines it based on the variableâ€™s assigned value at runtime.

Key Characteristics
Type Flexibility: Variables can hold values of any type, and their types can change during execution. For example, a variable that holds an integer can later be assigned a string without causing a compile-time error.

No Explicit Type Declaration: Unlike statically typed languages (such as C++ or Java), which require you to declare the type of a variable when you define it, dynamically typed languages (like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby) infer the type based on the current value.

Runtime Type Checking: Type errors (like adding a string to an integer) are caught during the execution phase rather than before execution. This can lead to more flexible code but also means that type errors may not be caught until the code is run, which may cause runtime errors.

Advantages
Ease of Use: No need for explicit type declarations, making it quicker to write code.
Flexibility: Supports rapid prototyping and more flexible code since types can change dynamically.
Disadvantages
Potential for Runtime Errors: Type-related errors may go undetected until runtime, which can make debugging harder.
Performance Impact: Runtime type checking can make dynamically typed languages slower compared to statically typed languages, as type information needs to be resolved on the fly.
Examples
In Python:

python
Copy code
x = 5       # x is inferred to be an integer
x = "hello" # Now, x is a string
Dynamically typed languages are often popular in scripting, web development, and rapid prototyping due to their flexibility.
